# README: Single-Point Acoustic Analysis of 5.56 NATO Gunshots (FFT)

## Project Context
**Live firing acoustic data acquisition**

- **Weapon System:** L98A2 Cadet General Purpose Rifle
- **Ammunition:** 5.56 NATO Ball (Supersonic)
- **Recording Location:** Between Firing Points 7–8 (multiple firers)
- **Local Features:** Console building (~9–10 m left), trees (right), hill downrange
- **Measurement Distance:** Immediate muzzle proximity (~0.5–1.5 m lateral)
- **Analysis Method:** Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on recorded pressure waveform

## 1. Acoustic Phenomena of a Single Gunshot

A rifle firing supersonic ammunition generates two main acoustic components:

- **Muzzle Blast (MB):** Rapid release of high-pressure gases; dominant at the firing point.
- **Ballistic Shock Wave (SW):** Mach cone generated by the supersonic bullet; highly directional and usually attenuated at lateral sensor positions.

**Observation:** At a single-point sensor near the muzzle, the MB dominates the signal both in amplitude and low-frequency content, while SW is often masked.

## 2. FFT Analysis

The FFT converts the time-domain pressure waveform \(P(t)\) into a frequency-domain spectrum \(F(\omega)\). Key insights:

### 2.1 Muzzle Blast Signature

| Characteristic | Frequency Range | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|------|
| Primary Peak   | 100–500 Hz     | Highest energy and amplitude; defines the dominant low-frequency band |
| Spectral Profile | Broadband, high amplitude | Peak SPL can exceed 170 dB near muzzle; low-frequency content dominates FFT |

### 2.2 Ballistic Shock Wave Signature

| Characteristic | Frequency Range | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|------|
| Primary Peak   | 1–4 kHz        | Present but masked by MB at firing point |
| Spectral Profile | Attenuated, lower amplitude | Highly directional; amplitude reduced lateral to bullet path |

## 3. Environmental and Firing Line Effects

- **Amplitude Dominance:** Local MB dominates due to proximity.
- **Acoustic Summation:** Nearby firers raise low-frequency energy (<500 Hz).
- **Reflections:**
  - Console building (~9–10 m left) introduces early echoes (spectral ripple).
  - Trees damp high-frequency content on the right.
  - Hill downrange introduces delayed reflections, sustaining low-frequency tail.
- **Time of Arrival (TOA):** Signal is a superposition of direct MB, nearby firers, early reflections, and reverberation.

## 4. Key Takeaways for Single-Point Measurements

- FFTs of shots near the muzzle are dominated by low-frequency MB energy.
- SW component may be present but usually heavily masked.
- Echoes and reflections can be detected in the time-domain waveform.
- Multiple firers can be distinguished by consistent echo patterns and waveform similarities.
- Analysis can extract:
  - Relative timing of shots and echoes
  - Spectral energy distribution (low vs high frequency)
  - Reverberation characteristics
  - Relative amplitude metrics (peak, RMS, SEL)

**Note:** Absolute SPL requires calibration due to phone or microphone response limitations.

## 5. Practical Recommendations

1. Record near muzzle for high SNR of MB.
2. Use minimal AGC and avoid clipping to preserve waveform integrity.
3. Extract WAV from video for uncompressed analysis.
4. Apply FFT with adequate window length (e.g., 2048–8192 points) and Hann window.
5. Use time-domain envelope and peak detection to identify echoes.
6. Multiple firers can potentially be separated by consistent echo patterns and waveform similarities.
